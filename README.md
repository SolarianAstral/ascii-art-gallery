#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/1y_fuwIaEXY>
#### Description:
This is my submission for the final project of Harvard's CS50x 2024, it's a web application
built with HTML, CSS and Python using the flask framework, it consists of a gallery of pictures made up of Ascii characters as well as
a converter to turn any image you want into Ascii Art. The application allows users to upload their own images, convert them into ASCII art, and view/download the results,
this website supports multiple file formats: png, jpg, jpeg, webp, and bmp.
The primary goal of the project is to use a big part of the knowledge that was gained through CS50x and turn it into a fun and good-looking project, providing a creative way to visualize images in text form. This project utilizes Python for the ASCII art conversion and Flask for web development.
